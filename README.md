# Interface

## Requirements:

### http Server

You can use for example the live server as a simple http server.

```zsh
npm install -g live-server
```

There is also a vscode extension. Search `ritwickdey.LiveServer` in the vscode extension store.

## Usage

Use the live-server command inside your folder or use the extension by right-clicking your index.html and select "Open with Live Server"

```zsh
live-server
```

### Interface

In the interface you get fine grained control over the pipeline

### Poster PDF

Upload your Font-File to the interface, then use strg+p or cmd+p and select pdf as output.
Then send us your pdf via [seafile](https://seafile.rlp.net/u/d/fc58cc43d8c247d2810a/).

### Barebones Example

If you want full control over the pipeline, use the barebones-example to hack your own interface.
